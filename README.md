# Using Common Widgets

In this chapter, I learned how to use common widgets in Flutter to build user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. Key widgets include Scaffold for the basic app layout, AppBar for navigation, and SafeArea to prevent content from overlapping with device edges. I practiced using Column and Row widgets for flexible UI layouts and explored how to nest them to create intricate designs. Additionally, I worked with Text and RichText for text display, incorporated Image and Icon widgets, and added decorative styling with Container. I also learned to use TextField for data input, applying validation, and handling user interactions.
